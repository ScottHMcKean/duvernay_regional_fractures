Data Quality Information: 
  Logical Consistency Report: Arcs are not directional, that is, the 'right-hand rule' is not followed for these data.
  Completeness Report: The authoring geologists located and digitized the major bedrock faults at their discretion. The faults may not represent a complete picture of the major faults in Alberta. Generally, we only digitized the major faults that intersect the bedrock subcrop.
  Lineage: 
    Process Step: 
      Process Description: Faults were digitized in ArcInfo as part of the compilation of Alberta Geological Survey Map 236.
