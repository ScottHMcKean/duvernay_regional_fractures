  Description: 
    Abstract: This GIS data set depicts the faults in the Peace River Arch Region, based on petroleum well log data including formation picks. Well data were sourced from Accumap and EUB data sets.  These faults are interpreted from structure top residual surfaces generated by the removal of geological trend. The geological trend was modelled using geostatistical analysis to highlight local offset in multiple, easily recognizable formation tops.The stratigraphic interval considered was from the Cretaceous down to the top of the PreCambrian.
    Purpose: The study was done to update our understanding of the structural setting  of the Peace River Arch region using geostatistical modelling .

Data Quality Information: 
  Logical Consistency Report: The features in the shapefile are lines indicating the location of potential faults interpreted from multiple geological surfaces. Lines may overlap because the same faults are recognized from multiple horizons. However each line is treated as a separate entity in this data set. Topological relationships may or may not exist among features. No fault plane orientation is implied in the arc directions as digitized (i.e. no right-hand rule was followed in digtizing the fault traces).
  Completeness Report: Outliers in the source data were removed using statistical analysis. Only faults which, in the judgement of the authoring geologist were likely to exist, were digitized.
  Positional Accuracy: 
    Horizontal Positional Accuracy: 
      Horizontal Positional Accuracy Report: Considering all sources of horizotal positional accuracy, features are estimated to be accurate to +/- 500 m, at 95% confidence.
    Vertical Positional Accuracy: 
      Vertical Positional Accuracy Report: Although the fault traces represented exist in 3 dimensions, they are represented in this data set as 2-D objects. Vertical posistional accuracy is not considered.

    Process Step: 
      Process Description: Formation picks from AGSWDB were first modelled using local polynomial interpolation to get a trend surface. This interpolation technique was found to be optimal in modelling geological trend versus mathematical trend using other interpolation techniques. Then a residual surface was genereated using the Simple Kriging methodology. Simple Kriging was applied on the residual formation picks after the removal of geological trend. Next, local neighbourhood statistics was applied to the residual formation top surface to highlight the formation top offset patterns. Finally, faults were intrepreted and digitized by hand on-screen following the offset patterns. The interpreted faults were evaluated by comparing their frequency of occurrence on all the considered stratigraphic surfaces. By looking at the overlapping pattern of these superimposed faults, the width of the pattern indicates the steepness of the fault plane.
